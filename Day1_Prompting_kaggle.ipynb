He was a bright spark, a budding robotics engineer living thousands of kilometers away in the bustling metropolis of Neo-Kyoto.  Before 5G, their weekly video calls were a frustrating slideshow of pixelated faces and dropped connections.  Now, thanks to the ubiquitous 5G network weaving its way across the globe, she could see Leo's face with breathtaking clarity, almost as if he were in the same room.\n",

He showed Elara a holographic projection of the drones, their intricate designs shimmering in the air, thanks to the ultra-low latency of the 5G network allowing for seamless real-time data transmission.  Without the speed and responsiveness of 5G, the complex calculations needed to coordinate the swarm would be impossible. The drones, a project reliant on instantaneous communication, were only a glimmer in his eye before the 5G revolution.\n",

            "Suddenly, news alerts flashed across Leo's screen. A massive earthquake had struck a remote island nation, cutting off communication and leaving millions in desperate need of aid.  Elara watched, her heart pounding, as Leo's team sprang into action.  The 5G network, resilient and far-reaching, allowed them to deploy the drones remotely, providing real-time assessments of the damage and guiding\n"

This eliminates the need to constantly run `git status` and provides at-a-glance awareness of your repository's state.\n\n* **Customization:**  The script allows for extensive customization of the prompt's appearance (colors, symbols, layout), and what information it displays.  You can choose from pre-defined themes or create your own.\n\n* **Cross-Shell Compatibility:** It strives for compatibility across bash and zsh shells.\n\nIn short, it's a tool to make working with Git more efficient and visually appealing by integrating crucial Git information directly into your shell prompt.\n"
